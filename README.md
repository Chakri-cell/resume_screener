# resume_screener
This project is a Resume Screening Tool built in Python using the scikit-learn library. It automates the process of analyzing and ranking resumes based on keywords, skills, and experience. The tool uses TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction and can be extended to include machine learning models for smarter candidate filtering.
